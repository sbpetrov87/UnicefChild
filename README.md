Correlations between early childhood experiences and literacy rates.
UNICEF, United Nations Children's Fund, is an agency of the United Nations responsible for providing humanitarian aid to children worldwide. Using their early childhood experiences dataset and Educational Outcomes dataset I identified how experiences in early childhood impact literacy in order to identify what academic or social programs should be available to children in early childhood.
